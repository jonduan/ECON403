# The R Optimization Infrastructure (ROI)

The R Optimization Infrastructure ([ROI](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ROI/ROI.pdf)) package promotes the development and use of open source optimization problem solvers for R.


ROI handle LP up to MILP and MIQCP problems using the following supported solvers :

1. lpSolve

2. quadprog

3. Rcplex

4. Rglpk (default)

5. Rsymphony

more...

#  Solvers

[CPLEX](https://www.r-bloggers.com/using-cplex-in-r-installing-cplexapi-in-windows-10/) and [Gurobi](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/prioritizr/vignettes/gurobi_installation.html) are commercial solvers. Students can get academic license. 

[GLPK](http://winglpk.sourceforge.net/) is free.

# Standard form for linear programming

Objective function:
$$f(x) =  c^T x.$$ 
Here, $x$ is a vector in $\mathbb{R}^n$, $c$ is a constant vector in $\mathbb{R}^n$.

A system of linear constraints on the vector $x \in \mathbb{R}^n$.

$$ Lx <= b $$ 

One example:


$$\begin{align*}     \text{maximize: }   2 x_1 &+ 4 x_2 + 3 x_3\\ \text{subject to: }     3 x_1 &+ 4 x_2 + 2 x_3 & <= 60 \\                        2 x_1 &+   x_2 +   x_3 & <= 40 \\                           x_1 &+ 3 x_2 + 2 x_3 & <= 80 
\end{align*}$$

# Hands on a small problem

[Example:](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2017/02/lintroductory-guide-on-linear-programming-explained-in-simple-english/) 

- Consider a chocolate manufacturing company which produces only two types of chocolate â€“ A and B. 

- Both the chocolates require Milk and Choco only.  To manufacture each unit of A and B, following quantities are required:

  - Each unit of A requires 1 unit of Milk and 3 units of Choco
  - Each unit of B requires 1 unit of Milk and 2 units of Choco

- The company kitchen has a total of 5 units of Milk and 12 units of Choco. 

- On each sale, the company makes a profit of

  - Rs 6 per unit A sold
  - Rs 5 per unit B sold.

# Quadratic Programming

we can write the quadratic program (QP) compactly as: 

$$\left\{ \begin{array}{l} \mathrm{minimize}_{x \in \mathbb{R}^n}: \qquad F(x) = \frac{1}{2} x^T Q x - L_1^T x  \\ \mathrm{subject\; to:} \qquad L_2x <= b \end{array} \right.$$

Here, $x$ is a vector in $\mathbb{R}^n$, $Q$ is an $n \times n$ symmetric positive definite matrix, $L_1$ is a constant vector in $\mathbb{R}^n$. The function $Q(x)$ is sometimes referred to as a quadratic form and it generalizes the quadratic function $q(x) = ax^2 +bx + c$ to higher dimensions.

# Standard form for quadratic programming problem

It will require putting problem in matrix form.

# Example #1:
Consider the objective function: 

$$\begin{eqnarray*} F(x,y) &=& \frac{1}{2} \left[ \begin{matrix} x & y \end{matrix} \right] \left[ \begin{matrix} 2 & -1 \\ -1 & 2 \end{matrix} \right] \left[ \begin{matrix} x \\ y \end{matrix} \right] - \left[ \begin{matrix} -3 & 2 \end{matrix} \right] \left[ \begin{matrix} x \\ y \end{matrix} \right] + 4 \\ &=& x^2 + y^2 -xy +3x -2y + 4 . \end{eqnarray*}$$ 



We set:
$$Q =  \left[ \begin{matrix} 2 & -1 \\ -1 & 2 \end{matrix} \right] \qquad  L_1 = \left[ \begin{matrix} -3 \\ 2 \end{matrix} \right].$$

# Standard form for Quadratic Progarmming

three decision variables: x1, x2, x3

$$\begin{align*}     \text{minimize: }   - 5 x_2 + 1/2 (x_1^2 + x_2^2 + x_3^2)\\ \text{subject to: }     -4 x_1 - 3 x_2       & >= -8 \\                         2 x_1 +   x_2       & >= 2 \\                         - 2 x_2 + x_3 & >= 0 \end{align*}$$

Could you put this problem into a matrix form?

# Portfolio optimization-minimum variance

To minimize the risk, we choose invest in 30 stocks and we need to decide the share for each stock.
Decision variables: x1, x2,..., x30. sum(x, i) = 1.
If xi is allowed to negative, it means we can borrow stock and sell it.


```{r}
## Portfolio optimization - minimum variance
## -----------------------------------------
## get monthly returns of 30 US stocks
suppressMessages(library("ROI"))
##   
data( US30 )  # 180 months for 30 stocks
r <- na.omit( US30 )
head(US30,2)
```
Could you use ROI to solve this questions?

# Minimize variance in ROI
```{r}
## objective function to minimize
obj <- Q_objective( 2*cov(r) ) # quadratic objective: x'Mx . M is variance convariance matrix: cov(r) . ## full investment constraint
full_invest <- L_constraint( rep(1, ncol(US30)), "==", 1 ) #  linear constraint for stock shares
#                           (1,1, ..., 1) * (x1,x2,..., x30) ==1
## create optimization problem / long-only
(op <- OP( objective = obj, constraints = full_invest )) 
```

# Solution


```{r}
## solve the problem - only works if a QP solver is registered
res <- ROI_solve( op )

round( sol[ which(sol > 1/10^6) ], 3 ) # only show large share stock. Not all 30 xi.
